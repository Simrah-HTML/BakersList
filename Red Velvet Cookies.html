        <br>
        Baking Sheet
        <br>
        Ingredients
        <br>
        <br>
        ▢1 cup unsalted butter (226g)
        <br>
        ▢1 cup granulated sugar (200g)
        <br>
        ▢1 egg
        <br>
        ▢2 teaspoons vanilla extract (10mL)
        <br>
        ▢2 cups all-purpose flour (240g)
        <br>
        ▢¼ cup cocoa powder (25g)
        <br>
        ▢½ teaspoon baking soda<br>
        ▢½ teaspoon baking powder<br>
        ▢¼ teaspoon kosher salt<br>
        <br>
        ▢1 tablespoon hot brewed coffee (15mL)<br>
        ▢1 tablespoon liquid red food coloring (15mL)<br>
        ▢¾ cup chopped semisweet chocolate chips (130g)<br>
        ▢12 ounces cream cheese softened, (340g)<br>
        ▢1 cup powdered sugar sifted, (100g)<br>
        ▢2 tablespoon milk or heavy cream (30mL)<br>
        ▢1 cup white chocolate chips (150g)<br>
        <br>
        Instructions<br>
        Sift the flour, cocoa, salt, baking soda, and baking powder into a bowl then whisk together and set aside.<br>
        Using a stand or hand mixer, beat butter and sugar in a bowl until creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg and vanilla until combined.<br>
        Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating on low speed until just combined.<br>
        Add coffee and red food coloring until evenly combined. (do not overbeat).<br>
        Fold in 1 cup chopped chocolate.<br>
        Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes.<br>
        Scoop dough using a 1 tablespoon scoop; gently roll between your hands to make smooth balls. Place dough balls on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart.<br>
        Bake at 350° until edges are firm, 10 to 12 minutes.<br>
        Let cool on pan 10 minutes; transfer cookies to a wire rack, and let cool completely.<br>
        Using a stand or hand mixer, beat cream cheese and powdered sugar until smooth. Beat in milk or heavy cream, if desired.<br>
        Spread about 1 tablespoon filling onto bottom sides of half of cookies. Top with remaining cookies, bottom-sides down.<br>
        
        Microwave white chocolate in a small bowl in 30-second intervals until smooth (about 3 times).<br>
        Spoon melted white chocolate into a ziploc plastic bag. Snip the corner off the bag, and drizzle cookies as desired. Freeze cookies for about 15 minutes to let chocolate set.<br>
        Notes<br>
        Use quality ingredients. Invest in high-quality cocoa powder and chocolate chips. The better the quality, the richer the flavor you’ll get out of this red velvet cookie recipe.<br>
        Opt for gel-based food coloring over liquid food coloring. It’s more concentrated, meaning you’ll get that vibrant red without adding too much liquid to your dough.<br>
        To avoid cookies that spread too much, chill your dough for at least 30 minutes before baking. This solidifies the fat, resulting in a thicker, softer cookie.<br>
        Room temperature ingredients are essential for perfectly creamy frosting. When making the cream cheese frosting, ensure the cream cheese and butter are well softened. This ensures a silky, lump-free texture.
        Use parchment paper or a silicone baking mat on your sheets to prevent the cookies from sticking and ensure even baking.<br>
        Don’t overbake! Red velvet cookies should be soft, so keep a close eye towards the end of baking. They may look slightly underbaked when they come out, but they’ll firm up as they cool.<br>
        Cool completely. Before sandwiching them with the cream cheese frosting, let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack. This prevents the frosting from melting into the cookie.<br>
