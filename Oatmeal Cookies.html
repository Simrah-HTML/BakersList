    <h1>Oatmeal Cookies</h1>
    <p>Equipment <br>
        ▢
        Electric hand mixer or stand mixer<br>
        ▢
        Mixing Bowls<br>
        ▢
        Rimmed baking sheets<br>
        ▢
        Parchment paper or silicone baking mats<br><br>
        Ingredients<br>
        
        ▢1½ cups all-purpose flour (180g)<br>
        ▢¾ teaspoon baking soda<br>
        ▢¼ teaspoon baking powder<br>
        ▢½ teaspoon salt<br>
        ▢1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>
        ▢1 cup unsalted butter room temperature (113g)<br>
        ▢1 cup packed light brown sugar (220g)<br>
        ▢½ cup granulated sugar (100g)<br>
        ▢2 large eggs<br>
        ▢2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
        ▢3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (336g)<br><br>
        Instructions<br>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.<br>
        
        In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter with both sugars. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes<br>
        Reduce speed to low. Add the egg and vanilla, and beat until well mixed, about 1 minute. Add the flour mixture and beat until almost combined. Stir in the oats. Scoop the dough into 2 tablespoon balls, cover, and chill for 1 hour or up to 72 hours.<br>
        Preheat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.<br>
        Place the dough balls about 2 inches apart on baking sheets.<br>
        Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center. Let cool on the pans for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.
                Notes<br><br>
        Get creative! Feel free to add up to 1 cup of the mix-ins of your choice. Some of my favorites include M&Ms, raisins, chopped nuts, and chocolate chips.<br>
        
        Patience is a virtue. While a long chill time isn’t required, refrigerating the dough balls for longer will make an even more delightfully chewy cookie. When time allows, I like to give the dough a full 72 hours in the fridge for the perfect chewy oatmeal cookies.
        Start with room temperature ingredients. Make sure your butter and eggs are at room temperature to ensure even mixing and a smoother, fluffier cookie dough.<br>
        Don’t overmix. Once you add the oats and any mix-ins, stir just until combined to prevent your cookies from turning tough.<br>
        Consistent size. Use a cookie scoop to ensure each cookie is the same size. This promotes even baking and ensures all cookies are done at the same time. If your cookie scoop has a number on it, look for #40 (2 tablespoon capacity) for this recipe.<br>
        Monitor your cookies. Oatmeal cookies can go from perfectly baked to overbaked in a minute. Keep an eye out and remember they’ll continue to cook a bit on the bottom after being removed from the oven due to the residual heat.<br>
        Mix-in magic. When adding mix-ins like chocolate chips, raisins, or nuts, try toasting the nuts first or soaking the raisins in warm water (or rum!), then draining very well, for a plump and juicy texture.<br>
        
        Storage secret. Store your cooled cookies with a slice of bread in an airtight container. The cookies will absorb the moisture from the bread, keeping them soft longer.<br><br>
