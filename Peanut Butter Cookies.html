    <p>Ingredients <br>
        INGREDIENTS:<br>
        <br>
        ▢1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 180g<br>
        ▢1/2 cup butter unsalted, room temp 113g<br>
        ▢1 cup peanut butter 250g<br>
        ▢1/2 cup brown sugar 100g, lightly packed<br>
        ▢1/2 cup sugar 100g<br>
        ▢1 tsp vanilla extract 5mL<br>
        ▢1 egg large, room temp<br>
        ▢3/4 tsp baking powder 3g<br>
        Instructions<br>
        INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
        Preheat over to 350F<br>
        <br>
        Sift flour and baking powder together then whisk to combine.
        Cream butter and sugars in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. You can add an optional 1/4-1/2 tsp sea salt.<br>
        Add peanut butter and mix until incorporated.<br>
        Mix in egg and vanilla extract then add flour mixture and beat until incorporated.<br>
        Roll dough into one inch balls and place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper.<br>
        Flatten cookies with a fork in a criss-cross pattern.<br>
        Bake cookies for about 10 minutes.<br>
        Allow cookies to cool completely on baking sheet, they need to set up before being transferred.<br>
        <br>
        Notes<br>
        You will bake the cookies until almost done. They will set up and continue baking with the residual internal heat after they're pulled out of the oven.<br>
        They will be VERY soft just out of the oven so let them rest for a while; when cooled they will be firm enough to handle and quite delicious.  <br>
        
        If your peanut butter is not on the salty side add 1/4-1/2 tsp salt to the batter.<br><br>
